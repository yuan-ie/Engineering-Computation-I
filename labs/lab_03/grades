T1:
    Excellent.

T2:
    Excellent.
T3:
    Excellent.

Q&A:
    (-3) Couln't explain the "." in the find command right away
    but easily figured it out with a bit of help.
    (-3) Wrong permissions on your directory.

Comments:
    Excellent as always. Just make sure to do research on everything
    you see, even if it seems trivial. You may be asked what every
    single thing does or mean to test your knowledge.
    Otherwise, great code, great commenting/formatting, and great
    explanations.

10 + 4 + 10 + 19 = 43/60 = 72%

T1:
    Excellent.

T2:
    (-3) Didn't know how to redirect output starting from p01 (where the
    mycat program was located) to p02. Make use of ".." instead of making
    another copy of the whole program to p02.
    (-3) Did not know how to find only the text files starting with p0.

    Besides that, was able to do the other commands just fine.

T3:
    "mycopy" program runs fine.
    Showed that there were no differences in the original and copied files.

Q&A:
    (-3) Didn't know why <find . -name "*.txt"> displayed so many txt files
    from the home directory.
    (-3) Thought "." searches through home directory.
    It searches through current directory.
    (-5) Didn't know how output would look like if it is different,
    and partially explained the output of the diff command when making
    a change in the copied file.

Comments:
    Make use of the cd command, especially "cd .." to go up a directory.
    You can also use sd instead of cd.
    I was surprised that you are this far without making use of ".."
    It is very helpful, especially when you want to copy, move, delete (etc.)
    files in an adjacent directory, without changing to that directory.

    Ex: If you are in p01/ and want to copy a file to p02/,
    ->   cp file.txt ../p02/file2.txt
        (this works because p01/ and p02/ are located in tanelli_salvatore/)

    Make sure to research on all parts of a command, even if it may look
    trivial.

8 + 8 + 6 + 25 = 47 / 60 = 78%

T1:
    (-2) mycat program has .py extension.
    Otherwise, excellent.
T2: 
    (-2) Needed a bit of help redirecting output from p01/ to p02/.

T3:
    (-2) Works fine, but your program prints when it shouldn't.
    (-2) mycopy program has .py extension.

Q&A:
    (-5) Didn't know what "." and "*" meant in the find command.
    Otherwise, was able to answer all my questions well.

Comments:
    Make sure to read the directions carefully.
    If it says the program should be able to do:
        mycat <file>
    then the program doesn't need the extenstion.
    If your program is executable and has the python shebang,
    you should be able to run the command as a python file,
    even without the .py extension. Same for mycopy program.

    Also do research on all parts of a command, even if it seems trivial.
    Otherwise, Great job!

6 + 7 + 8 + 25 = 46/60 = 77%

T1: 
    (-2) For some reason, your program is named mycopy.py in p01/
    (-2) Does not need .py extenson.
T2: 
    (-3) Didn't know how to redirect output starting from p01 (where the
    mycat program was located) to p02. 

T3: Worked perfectly, and could explain the diff command.
    (-2) Does not need .py extension.

Q&A:
    Explained well why <find . -name "*.txt"> showed so many text files.
    Knew how to search for only the desired files.
    (-5) Didn't know what "." and "*" meant in the find command.

Comments:
    Make sure to read the directions carefully.
    If it says the program should be able to do:
        mycat <file>

10 + 10 + 3 + 16 = 39/60 = 65%

T1: Excellent.

T2:
    Did the commands correctly.

T3:
    (-2) mycopy shouldn't print to the terminal.
    (-5) should have a separate copy for mycopy, but instead
    combined it with mycat.

Q&A:
    (-3) Didn't know why <find . -name "*.txt"> displayed so many txt files
    from the home directory.
    (-3) Wrong permissions on your directory.
    (-3) Could not explain "*" in the find command.
    (-5) Overall took a lot of time because not very familiar with many
    commands.

Comments:
    When you have to write multiple programs that are very similar,
    keep them as separate programs rather than combining, especially
    since they are separate tasks.

    Study a lot more on the commands went over in your lectures.
    It's harder to remember things just by reading. Practice using them too.
    A lot of time was spent troubleshooting or mistaken commands like
    exiting without saving.
