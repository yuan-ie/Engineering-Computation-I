	Try to understand what you are coding. Be sure to know how
	to explain what you coded. Even if a lot of it came through
	online tutorials, dissect each part. That is my method of
	learning. :)

	Make sure to always format your code.
	You have a good understanding about loops and your code.
	The only constraint seems to be time. It may be difficult,
	but try to get your labs done or mostly done before the lab
	day, so you can use that time to ask questions and fix anything. 
	You can email me if you have any questions too! :)
