gcc file.c -o filename
    -> filename is an executable with no -c flag

gcc -c file.c -o filename.o
    -> -c flag lets compiler know to output as an object file

gcc file.o -o filename
gcc file1.o file2.o file3.o -o filename # where file1 has main function
gcc file1.c file2.o file3.o -o filename # .c has main function
    -> compile object file to executable
    -> can fo incremental compiles
    -> second and third line are similar



# function containing main program should have #include "file.h" // header file
# header file may contain functions of other .o files to be used
