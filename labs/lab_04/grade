7 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 15/60 = 25%

T1:
	(-3) Wrong output format.
T2:
	(-10) Nothing provided.
T3:
	(-10) Nothing provided.
Q&A:
	(-3) No error for no argument.
	(-3) No error for one argument.
	(-4) Not much understanding about try and except.
	(-12) None of the error checks can be completed.

Comments:
	The material is getting harder, and I know that
	you may be busy prioritizing other classes, but
	please don't hesitate to reach out!

	If the office hours do not line up, send an email
	and we could always make things work!

	In general, you seem to have a good understanding
	on the labs and assignments, so I know that you
	will get through this as long as you reach out. :)

8 + 10 + 8 + 5 = 31/60 = 52% 

T1:
	(-2) Output is not showing 4 places after the decimal.
T2:
	Excellent.
T3:
	(-2) Output array is containing strings, not floats.
Q&A:
	(-25) No error messages and no uses of try-except blocks.

Comments:
	Make sure to read directions carefully.
	The lab instructions say to make sure you find as many
	errors as possible and attach error messages to those.
	Definitely study up on try-except. They are very useful
	for error checking.

10 + 10 + 10 + 23 = 53/60 = 88%

T1: 
	Excellent!
T2:
	Excellent!
T3: 
	Excellent!
Q&A:
	(-3) Wrong error message for wrong dimensions.
	(-4) Has too many things going on after the error.
	Use sys.exit() to exit the program before it continues
	running it more errors so the output can be clean.

6 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 32/60 = 53%

T1: 
	(-4) Wrong output, output is supposed to be a scalar.
T2:
	(-2) Didn't work initially until one of the error
	checks were commented out.
	(-2) Answer is outputting as a list of strings,
	not floats.
T3:
	(-2) Output is a list of strings
Q&A:
	(-4) No error message for no argument throughout all.
	(-4) No error message for one argument throughout all.
	(-2) Wrong error message for non-number constant.
	(-2) Wrong error message for vector containing string.
	(-3) Dimension check not working properly.
	(-3) Couldnt answer question about try and except.

Comments:
	Your programs work, however make sure to check if the
	output matches as required. Having an output as strings,
	and not a float could be a small but detrimental mistake,
	especially when you are connecting multiple programs.
	Keep that in mind for future assignments or projects!

	Another thing is to always think about all the types or
	errors a program can have. An argument may be missing,
	an argument might be the wrong type, a file contains the
	wrong things (or is corrupted), etc. Make sure these error
	messages are describing the right thing too!

existing file
vector lengths
contains non number
file extension
check if constant is non number
what if no arguments
what if one argument

make sure output as float to 4 decimal points

a x b : b x c : a x c

 b b b b     c c c    c c c
a	    b	     a
a	 x  b	  =  a
a	    b	     a
	    b
