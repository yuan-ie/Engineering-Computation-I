38 + 40 + 80 = 99%

T1:
    (-2) Matched lines where the window goes past the scope
    of the file did not indicate any match when there is a
    match. -- This was easily fixed.
T2:
    Excellent.
Q&A:
    Excellent.

Javier Schorle

33 + 30 + 69 = 82%

T1:
    (-2) Didnt have default n-value when -n is not specified.
    (-5) Doesn't have that space cushion for windows going out
    of bounds of EOF. It repeats lines from BOF instead.

T2: 
    (-5) Doesn't work for multiple files.
    (-5) Has a fixed order.

Q&A:
    (-3) Couldn't explain how some lines were indexed.
    (-3) Couldn't not explain the error check method when -w
    is placed at the end with no associated value.
    (-5) Some functions that were used were not explained
    correctly.

Salvatore Tanelli

29 + 20 + 75 = 78%

T1:
    (-3) Has a somewhat fixed order. (Doesn't account for
    -w or -n being placed at the end.)
    (-3) Didn't account for case sensitivity. Fixed it easily.
    (-5) Theres an issue when multiple matches are shown within
    the same window.

T2:
    (-15) Not working. Doesn't print anything.
    (-5) The structure of the overall code is not correct, but
    on the right path.
Q&A:
    (-5) Some functions that were used were not explained
    correctly.

Sahil Singh

22 + 22 + 50 = 59%

T1: 
    (-10) Didn't work initially. Nothing was printing.
    (-3) The file parsing did not work.
    (-5) Does not work with -n unspecified.
T2:
    (-15) Doesn't work. Nothing was printing.
    (-3) The way -w was set up, it looks optional rather than
    required.
Q&A:
    (-5) Couldn't explain how the arguments parsed.
    The method was not efficient or practical.
    (-25) A lot of the functions or methods used to implement
    parsing or finding lines with the matched word could not
    be explained.


Thomas E Taaffe

15 + 35 + 50 = 63%

T1: 
    (-3) doesnt show the second half of the window when a line
    has a match.
    (-5) Matched lines where the window goes past the scope
    of the file gives an error rather than printing the
    remaining strings within the window.
    (-2) Works with any n-value except for n=1.
    (-5) Options have fixed positions.
    (-5) Does not work with -n unspecified.
    (-5) Doesn't work with multiple matches.
T2:
    (-5) Matched lines where the window goes past the scope
    of the file gives an error rather than printing the
    remaining strings within the window.
Q&A:
    (-30) A lot of the functions or methods used to implement
    parsing or finding lines with the matched word could not
    be explained.
