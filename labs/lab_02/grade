T1:  Excellent.
T2:  Excellent.
T3:  Excellent.
T4:  Excellent.
Q&A: Excellent.

Comments: Knew how to do every part of each task confidently.
	  Knew the differences between scripts and programs,
	  and the outputs between both the myprog.py and myscript.py files.
	  Also, all codes were well formatted, well commented, just as the examples.
	  Knew why it was important to have consistency in commenting.

10 + 5 + 10 + 2 + 50 = 77/90 = 86%

T1:  Excellent.
T2:  (-5) Did not know how to save to a new file.
T3:  Excellent.
T4:  (-8) Wrote the file as a script instead of a program.
     Didn't work initally. Also did not follow the correct format
     for the coding, as well as not commented.
Q&A: knew that the myscript.py and myprog.py would output the same results,
     even if one was a program that passed an argument. Fully explained
     well the differences. Also knew why commenting and and being consistent
     with coding is important (Just didn't display that during the
     coding assignments).

Comments: I noticed that you were not making use of the tab auto-completion.
	  You mostly typed everything by the character on the commandline.
	  It is much easier when you start using that. Also, make sure to
	  know what you are coding. Even if you looked for a program online,
	  analyze it line by line to learn what you are doing.

10 + 5 + 10 + 4 + 50 = 79/90 = 88%

T1:  Excellent.
T2:  (-5) Did not know how to save to a new file.
T3:  Excellent.
T4:  (-6) Program works but there were no comments made.
     It is important to document your code so you know what you have coded.
Q&A: Knew why it was important to comment and be consistent. Also knew the differences
     well between a script and program. Answered all my conceptual questions correctly.

Comments: No matter how small the code is, even if it is very obvious, always comment.
	  It's always best practice to comment everything so it comes naturally.
	  It also helps a lot when you need to remember what you wrote. Easy to forget.

10 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 35 = 58/90 = 64%

T1:  Excellent.
T2:  (-5) Can't save to a new file.
T3:  (-7) Could only explain the visual differences but nothing else.
T4:  (-5) Commenting format is not correct.
Q&A: Conceptual questions answered fine.
     (-15) Didn't know if the outputs of the script and program would be the same or different.
     Didn't understand the function and the argument that passes through.

Comments: You should do a bit of review and outside studying about functions and arguments.
	  Although the outputs result the same way, the program is not just another way to write
	  the script. The program is different because it handles an argument. Although the
	  argument is not being used anywhere, the program could be very different if the argument
	  played a part in writing the code. Also, whenever you get the chance, always
	  test run all the codes (even the codes you have access to that are not written by you).
	  Analyze them, understand why it appears the same or different from you expected.




Salvatore Tanelli

10 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 20 = 48/90 = 53%

T1:  Excellent.
T2:  Excellent.
T3:  (-7) Couldn't fully explain the differences between script and program.
T4:  (-5) The template was not used and commenting/coding format was not correct.
Q&A: (-30) Didn't understand what a function was or how it works.
     Says the outputs of the script and program would be the same but didn't know why.
     Didn't really know why commenting was important in a real-world setting.

Comments: Rememeber to comment consistently, not just because you are told to do so.
	  A great coder codes great not just because of their skill, but also because it can
	  be understood and become of use to other people. Today, Dr. Picone told me
	  that we want to write code that can last 100 years. :) If you are leaving the code
	  and no one understands it, the code will not make it past a year. It's important
	  that even your future group buddies or coworkers can understand what you did.
	  Even yourself too. It's easy to forget what we had written ourselves.

	  Also read up a bit more on functions, arguments, and returns. It's a huge part
	  of coding.

10 + 10 + 5 + 10 + 40 = 75/90 = 83%

T2:  Excellent.
T2:  Excellent.
T3:  (-5) Cannot explain why the two files will give the same output.
T4:  Excellent.
Q&A: (-10) Could not explain well about the components of a program.
     Both myscript.py and myprog.py output the same thing, but they could easily be different
     because myprog.py has a function that passes an argument when it runs.
     Although the argument is not being used, if it was used, it could lead to a different output,
     so both files are not exactly interchangeable.

Comments: I suggest studying a bit more about functions, arguments, and variables.
	  They make up a huge part of coding. Besides that, great job on the other questions!

10 + 5 + 5 + 10 + 40 = 70/90 = 78%

T1:  Excellent.
T2:  (-5) Didn't know how to save as a new file.
T3:  (-5) Thinks the output of both products would be different.
T4:  Excellent.
Q&A: (-10) Both program and script outputs the same thing.
     The values of the variables used and the print statements are the same.
     However, they are different because the program could result in a different output easily.
     It has an argument passed through. Since the argument was not used, the output was the same.
     There was not much of a point to include it. If it was used, we could have easily added the
     number to the float, making the output different in values. Besides that, great job on the question!
