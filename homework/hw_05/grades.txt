10 + 7 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 80%

T1:
    Excellent.
T2:
    (-3) The float variable should be printed with four
    decimal points. (You should also declare your float
    with all the numbers after the point: 
    "float sum = 27.272727272727;")
T3:
    Excellent.
T4:
    (-3) You should be reading the file from stdin (which
    is the terminal input), not hardcoding the file. 
    You can do this by using fgetc(stdin), no need to open
    the file.
    (-4) Should be printing line by line, but printing character
	by character.
    (-2) No explanation of comparing your program to
    "more" and "cat".
Formatting: 
    Excellent.

    Just as how you formatted your code in Python, do it the
    same way for C. Use the example code in the lecture 12
    directory for reference. Good job getting everything to
    work though!

    Excellent job!! Everything works perfectly.
    Just want to add that your program in task 4 can
    definitely be done in a less complicated way, but
    at least it works the way we want it to. :)
