7 + 7 + 10 + 9 = 66%

T1:
    (-3) Your code only outputted the results of the first
    test case since you had everything else commented.

    (no points off for this -- just explanation for above)
    I believe the reason you commented the rest is because
    some of your testcases outputs everything. You didn't fix
    the if-statement conditions for the larger-range testcases.
    It should be "(i<-99994)", not "(i<-4)" or "(i<4)".

T2:
    (-3) I ran your code and it gives a segfault when no argument
    is put. If you are doing it this way (which is efficent),
    handle it with a usage and help message. 

PDF:
    (-10) You should be explaining your code for the different 
    variable types. And you should put outputs with explanations
    for all test cases, not just having a summary for each task.
    Also label your figures (the texboxes).

Format:
    (-1) Not indented well for T1.

Comments*
    Don't let someone feel the need to decipher your code to
    figure out how it works. Even with the instructions, any-
    thing can be coded in any way. And although it's tedious,
    put pretty much everything in pdf. No need to add the code
    for the larger ranges. But show and explain the output of
    the larger ranges.

    Ask me more about the format later for future pdfs.

7 + 0 + 6 + 3 = 32%

T1:
    (-3) Your code only outputted the results of one test case.
    I assume you just changed the types and ranges manually.

    (To avoid a large output, you should have just used if-statements
    in your loop to only print the first couple and last couple
    iterations. And you should do all the work even if it's tedious.)
T2:
    (-10) Not provided.
PDF:
    (-14) T2 not provided. Not all parts of T1 was mentioned.
    Formatting of the snippets of code, etc. are wrong.

Format:
    (-7) The format was used but there is no comments.

10 + 10 + 17 + 10 = 94%

T1: 
    Excellent,
    but you should print "if ((i<4)||(i>99994))" before your print
    statements so it only prints the first couple and last couple
    iterations.
T2:
    Excellent.
PDF:
    (-3) Explain under or above each output and make sure you are
    referencing them correctly (within the demonstration section).
    The brief code should explain what you did in your code or how
    it works (basically the process).
Format:
    Excellent.
Comments*
    Great job!!

7 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 40%

T1:
    (-3) Your code only outputted the results of one test case.
    I assume you just changed the types and ranges manually.

    (To avoid a large output, you should have just used if-statements
    in your loop to only print the first couple and last couple
    iterations. And you should do all the work even if it's tedious.)
T2:
    (-5) Your code only outputted the results of one test case.
    I assume you just changed the types and ranges manually.

    (include all the different test cases in your code and output
    everything.)
PDF:
    (-15) Not well formatted and doesn't show outputs of all testcases
    and explanations for each. Also the explanations provided are too short.
    All of the code should be provided at the end too.
Format:
    (-5) No format and comments for T1.
    (-2) Not well formatted for T2.

6 + 7 + 17 + 10 = 80%

T1:
    (-3) Your code only outputted the results of one test case.
    I assume you just changed the types and ranges manually.
    (-1) The parameters of your main function was wrong, that the
    make file didn't work. (I fixed it to run the code)
T2:
    (-3) Your code only outputted the results of one test case.
    I assume you just changed the types and ranges manually.
