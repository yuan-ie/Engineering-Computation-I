Code:
    Excellent.
PDF:
    (-3) Appendix should include all your code.
    Give brief descriptions of all your functions you created.
    Explain your test cases too. Don't just put the inputs/outputs.
Format:
    Excellent.

    1. In your first if-statement in the main function,
        you should do both (argc>3) && (argc<3) instead of one.
        Such as, what if there are three or more arguments?
    Great job!

Code:
    Excellent.
PDF:
    (-1) Explain your test cases instead of only showing inputs/outputs.
    (-1) You don't have any screenshots or output showing a matrix from a file
    with rows of different lengths. (each row containing different number
    of elements)
    (-1) Give brief descriptions of all your functions you created.
Format:
    Excellent.

9 + 7 + 7 = 77%

Code:
    (-1) Your main function should mostly do function calls.
    Free the matrices in a separate function. Also print your
    matrices in a separate function.
PDF:
    (-2) Does not follow the doc format.
    (-1) It has very good descriptions but align your headers
    and textboxes better. Such as, why does "4)" have more
    indentation that "4a)"? And why are your text boxes way
    past the left margin?
Format:
    (-3) Your implementation file is not well commented.

    Good job! Work on formatting your PDF better and comment more
    too! USE THE DOC FORMAT.

10 + 8 + 10 = 93%

Code:
    Excellent.
PDF:
    (-1) Align the textboxes better. Also your last textbox goes
    way past the margin for some reason.
    (-1) You don't have any screenshots or output showing a matrix from a file
    with rows of different lengths. (each row containing different number
    of elements)
Format:
    Excellent.

    Really great work!! Make sure your PDF formatting visually makes
    sense. Align things better and take away pages that are empty.
