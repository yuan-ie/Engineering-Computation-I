T1:
    (-1) Error message is wrong when one or no arguments inputted.
T2:
    (-1) Error message is wrong when no arguments inputted.
        -> Print a usage message instead.
    (-1) Segfaults with no arguments.
    (-5) Your program only works with != 2 arguments because you had
    put EVERYTHING into that if statement. Make sure to check if your
    is correctly placed inside or outside the block.
        -> It works, but handling the commandline argument indices
        are wrong. It should work when it == 2 arguments.
